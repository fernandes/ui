# ARIA

Components are supposed to use follow the ARIA standards, it's great because people can use with assistive technologies, I also tend to focus on it, because I like using a website/software just with the keyboard.

Check [W3 ARIA Patterns](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/)

- [Accordion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/) and [example](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/accordion/examples/accordion/)
